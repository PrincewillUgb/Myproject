        <h1>COFFEE MADE WITH LOVE AND PASSION</h1>
        <p>
          Coffee is an industry built on inequalityâ€”where unseen workers have
          little voice in the marketplace for the fruit of their labors. As a
          result of these long-held, traditional practices within coffee, most
          coffee growers live in poverty. In recent years, coffee drinkers have
          become more aware of this history, fueling a growing demand among
          consumers for great tasting coffee that is also ethically and
          sustainably sourced. However, we know that buying coffee can be
          confusing and that labels can oftentimes be misleading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coffee Made With Love And Passion, our company mission, is all about
          giving selling power back to coffee farmers as well as purchasing
          power into the hands of our customers. Our long term farming partners
          negotiate their pricing based on cost of production as well as quality
          of product, not on fluctuating, unpredictable market pricing. This
          enables them to create thriving businesses with bright futures.
          Consumers are empowered by knowing exactly who grows their coffee and
          how, as well as knowing they are part of a new, sustainable, global
          coffee network. In this flourishing system, customers gain reliable
          access to exceptional coffee, even in unstable times.
        </p>
        <h4>How It All Began</h4>
        <p>
          In 2006, we began roasting coffee, relying heavily on labels and
          information from importers to understand what we were sourcing. But in
          2010, we met our first direct trade farming partner, Ben Waker
          friendship that radically shifted our understanding of coffee growing
          and sourcing. It also started us on a new path. We discovered the
          perpetual fulfillment we get from connecting exceptional coffee
          growers with appreciative coffee drinkers. That joy has kept us going
          ever since. Over the years, we have been honored to have our coffees
          win several Awards.
